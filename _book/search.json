Commonly referred “average”, find number adding numbers data set together divide total number points used. easily done calculator working less 20 digits, however almost never case data science. Often, especially R, dealing data sets hundreds, thousands, maybe even hundreds thousands data points. Fortunately, R takes pain away process offers simple function . Start creating object contains list numbers, simply use mean function calculate average variable.median data set data point fall middle points ordered lowest highest. , something easily found even without calculator small data sets, however humans can miscount data sets just massive us . R never makes counting mistakes using simple function save hours mundane counting. Start way found mean creating object various numbers simply use median function.Many people heard standard deviation, many can provide accurate definition. Standard deviation measure variance (see next paragraph) numbers data set data set’s mean. Typically lower standard deviation want see proves little variance data set typically means higher correlation. wanted find hand find square root variance point mean. easy numbers need, almost never case thus calculate variance hand much work. take extra steps R can ? sd() function work without hassle, identify object want find standard deviation .Finally, can cover variance. Variance measure distance two numbers. statistic often used measure spread data can used determine model’s accuracy. Typically, higher variance means model inaccurate. , building models reviewing summary statistics, want variance low possible. var() function find variance variable , however typically create confusion matrix (discussed later section) help determine variance, thus accuracy model.","code":"\na <- c(3.8,4,3.1,2.1,12.6,17,8.43,11,2,3,9,5,3,0.5)\n\nmean(a)\n#> [1] 6.037857\nb <- c(3.8,4,3.1,2.1,12.6,17,8.43,11,2,3,9,5,3,0.5)\n\nmedian(b)\n#> [1] 3.9\nd <- c(3.8,4,3.1,2.1,12.6,17,8.43,11,2,3,9,5,3,0.5)\n\nsd(d)\n#> [1] 4.821066"},{"path":"objects-and-arithmetic.html","id":"exercises-1","chapter":"9 Objects and Arithmetic","heading":"9.4 Exercises","text":"DefineDecide result following:\nlength(x)\nsum(x)\nsum(x^2)\nx+y\nx*y\nx-2\nx^2\nlength(x)sum(x)sum(x^2)x+yx*yx-2x^2Use R check answers.Decide following sequences use R check answers:\n7:11\nseq(2,9)\nseq(4,10,=2)\nseq(3,30,length=10)\nseq(6,-4,=-2)\n7:11seq(2,9)seq(4,10,=2)seq(3,30,length=10)seq(6,-4,=-2)Determine result following R expressions, use R check right:\nrep(2,4)\nrep(c(1,2),4)\nrep(c(1,2),c(4,4))\nrep(1:4,4)\nrep(1:4,rep(3,4))\nrep(2,4)rep(c(1,2),4)rep(c(1,2),c(4,4))rep(1:4,4)rep(1:4,rep(3,4))Use rep function define simply following vectors R.\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,8,5,8,5,8,5,8\n5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,65,8,5,8,5,8,5,85,5,5,5,8,8,8,8","code":"\nx<-c(4,2,6)\ny<-c(1,0,-1)"},{"path":"summaries-and-subscripting.html","id":"summaries-and-subscripting","chapter":"10 Summaries and Subscripting","heading":"10 Summaries and Subscripting","text":"","code":""},{"path":"summaries-and-subscripting.html","id":"introduction-2","chapter":"10 Summaries and Subscripting","heading":"10.1 Introduction","text":"Let’s suppose ’ve collected data experiment stored object x:simple summary statistics data can produced:self explanatory.may , however, subsequently learn first 6 data points correspond measurements made one machine, second six another machine.might lead us want summarize two sets data separately, need extract \nx two relevant subvectors. achieved subscripting:subsets can created obvious way. example:Negative integers can used exclude particular elements. examplehas effect ","code":"\nx<-c(7.5,8.2,3.1,5.6,8.2,9.3,6.5,7.0,9.3,1.2,14.5,6.2)\nmean(x)\n#> [1] 7.216667\nvar(x)\n#> [1] 11.00879\nsd(x)\n#> [1] 3.317949\nsummary(x)\n#>    Min. 1st Qu.
