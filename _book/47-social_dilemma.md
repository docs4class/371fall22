# Social Dilemma

## Your assignment

Fine People:

Please recall that for class on **Monday February 21, 2022** you were to have watched the movie The Social Dilemma which you can find on Netflix.  Afterwards you were to have Googled Facebook – what news is going on with them ethically right now?

Please have a one to two SINGLE SPACED page paper to turn in answering some/all of these questions:

- Do you believe that social media addiction is real?  What can you do to help prevent an addiction to social media?
- Do social media companies have a responsibility for how their platforms impact people? Society?
- Why do you use social media? Is that the only way for you to achieve those things?
- After watching the film, do you plan to change any of your privacy settings on social media? Which ones, and why or why not?
- Have you ever seen an ad for something you had only talked or thought about? How did it make you feel?
- What is one part of the film that really resonates with you? Connect it to a personal experience.
- Do you fact check everything you see online? What is one time you have read only the title or beginning of an article, but shared it anyway?
- What sources do you trust for news? Why do you trust these sources and do you ever get information from elsewhere?
- Can you think of a time where you said or did something online that you probably wouldn’t do in person?
- Think of a time where you have seen hate comments on a celebrity’s social media post. How does being behind a screen change how a person sees people on the other side?
